# TimetableGenerator
 Web application to manage students and teachersâ€™ schedules. Timetable management is the organization of lessons working within an establishment.
 This is a complex management given the multiple constraints and parameters that must be taken into account:</br>
 Finding a free room on the day and at the time when the teacher is available and where the group of students is not taking another class is not an easy task.

## Ensure data integrity </br>
For better efficiency, the deletion of a module is automatically controlled by verifying the existence of the materials belonging to this module. If a module contains subjects, you must first delete its subjects. </br> </br>

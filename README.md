# TimetableGenerator
 Web application to manage students and teachersâ€™ schedules. Timetable management is the organization of lessons working within an establishment.
 This is a complex management given the multiple constraints and parameters that must be taken into account:</br>
 Finding a free room on the day and at the time when the teacher is available and where the group of students is not taking another class is not an easy task.
